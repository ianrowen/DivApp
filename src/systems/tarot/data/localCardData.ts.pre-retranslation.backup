      "en": "With light step, as if earth and its trammels had little power to restrain him, a young man in gorgeous vestments pauses at the brink of a precipice among the great heights of the world; he surveys the blue distance before him-its expanse of sky rather than the prospect below. His act of eager walking is still indicated, though he is stationary at the given moment; his dog is still bounding. The edge which opens on the depth has no terror; it is as if angels were waiting to uphold him, if it came about that he leaped from the height. His countenance is full of intelligence and expectant dream. He has a rose in one hand and in the other a costly wand, from which depends over his right shoulder a wallet curiously embroidered. He is a prince of the other world on his travels through this one-all amidst the morning glory, in the keen air. The sun, which shines behind him, knows whence he came, whither he is going, and how he will return by another path after many days. He is the spirit in search of experience. Many symbols of the Instituted Mysteries are summarized in this card, which reverses, under high warrants, all the confusions that have preceded it.\nIn his Manual of Cartomancy, Grand Orient has a curious suggestion of the office of Mystic Fool, as apart of his process in higher divination; but it might call for more than ordinary gifts to put it into operation. We shall see how the card fares according to the common arts of fortune-telling, and it will be an example, to those who can discern, of the fact, otherwise so evident, that the Trumps Major had no place originally in the arts of psychic gambling, when cards are used as the counters and pretexts. Of the circumstances under which this art arose we know, however, very little. The conventional explanations say that the Fool signifies the flesh, the sensitive life, and by a peculiar satire its subsidiary name was at one time the alchemist, as depicting folly at the most insensate stage.",
      "zh": "腳步輕盈，彷彿塵世的羈絆與束縛對他毫無限制，一位身著華麗服飾的年輕男子佇立於世界高峰的懸崖峭壁之畔；他凝視眼前湛藍的遠方——那是無垠的天空，而非腳下的景緻。儘管他此刻駐足，其躍躍欲試的姿態卻依然清晰可見；他的忠犬依然活蹦亂跳。眼前深邃的懸崖對他而言毫無懼色；彷彿有天使在等候著，一旦他從高處躍下，便會將他托起。他的臉龐充滿智慧與對未來的憧憬。他一手持著玫瑰，另一手握著一支珍貴的魔杖，一個精緻刺繡的錢包從魔杖上懸掛，垂在他的右肩。他是異世界的王子，正在此世間遊歷，在晨光的輝映中，呼吸著清冽的空氣。照耀在他身後的太陽，知曉他從何而來，將往何處去，以及多日之後他將如何循另一條路徑歸返。他是尋求體驗的靈魂。此牌彙聚了諸多神聖奧秘的象徵，並在至高無上的法則之下，逆轉了一切先前的困惑。\n\n在《占卜手冊》中，「大東方」對於「神祕愚者」的角色有著獨特的見解，將其視為高等占卜過程的一部分；然而要將此付諸實踐，可能需要超凡的天賦。我們將探討此牌在普通常見的占卜之術中呈現的意涵；對於那些具備洞察力的人來說，這將證明一個顯而易見的事實：當紙牌被用作籌碼和藉口時，大阿爾克那牌最初並未用於心靈賭局的藝術之中。然而，對於這項藝術是如何起源的，我們卻知之甚少。傳統的解釋認為，「愚者」象徵著肉體與感官生活，而透過一種奇特的諷刺，它曾有一個副名叫做「鍊金術士」，藉此描繪最為愚昧的境地。"

      "en": "A youthful figure in the robe of a magician, having the countenance of divine Apollo, with smile of confidence and shining eyes. Above his head is the mysterious sign of the Holy Spirit, the sign of life, like an endless cord, forming the figure 8 in a horizontal position . About his waist is a serpent-cincture, the serpent appearing to devour its own tail. This is familiar to most as a conventional symbol of eternity, but here it indicates more especially the eternity of attainment in the spirit. In the Magician's right hand is a wand raised towards heaven, while the left hand is pointing to the earth. This dual sign is known in very high grades of the Instituted Mysteries; it shews the descent of grace, virtue and light, drawn from things above and derived to things below. The suggestion throughout is therefore the possession and communication of the Powers and Gifts of the Spirit. On the table in front of the Magician are the symbols of the four Tarot suits, signifying the elements of natural life, which lie like counters before the adept, and he adapts them as he wills. Beneath are roses and lilies, the flos campi and lilium convallium, changed into garden flowers, to shew the culture of aspiration. This card signifies the divine motive in man, reflecting God, the will in the liberation of its union with that which is above. It is also the unity of individual being on all planes, and in a very high sense it is thought, in the fixation thereof. With further reference to what I have called the sign of life and its connexion with the number 8, it may be remembered that Christian Gnosticism speaks of rebirth in Christ as a change \"unto the Ogdoad.\" The mystic number is termed Jerusalem above, the Land flowing with Milk and Honey, the Holy Spirit and the Land of the Lord. According to Martinism, 8 is the number of Christ.",
      "zh": "一位身穿魔法師長袍的年輕人，面容如神聖的阿波羅般，帶著自信的笑容和炯炯有神的雙眼。在他的頭頂上方，是聖靈的奧秘記號，生命的象徵，形如一條無盡的繩索，橫向呈現無限符號 (∞)。他的腰間繫著一條蛇形腰帶，銜尾蛇似在吞噬自己的尾巴。對大多數人而言，這是一個永恆的傳統象徵，但在這裡，它更特別地指出靈性成就的永恆。\n\n魔法師的右手高舉魔杖指向天堂，而左手指向大地。這種雙向手勢在高級秘傳學會的極高層級中廣為人知；它展現了恩典、德行與光明的降臨，源自高天並傳導至凡塵。因此，貫穿始終的寓意便是掌握並傳遞聖靈的力量與恩賜。\n\n魔法師前方的桌上擺放著塔羅牌四種牌組的象徵，代表著自然生命的元素，它們如同籌碼般擺放在這位奧秘行者面前，他能隨心所欲地運用。桌下是玫瑰與百合，已轉化為園藝花卉，象徵著抱負的涵養。這張牌象徵著人類內在的神性動機，反映著神，是意志在與至高者合一時獲得的解放。它也是個體存在於所有層面上的合一，從極高的意義而言，它是思想的凝定。\n\n進一步參考我所稱的生命記號及其與數字8的連結，或許可以回憶起基督教靈知主義將在基督裡的重生稱為一種「進入八重界」的轉變。這個神秘數字被稱為「天上的耶路撒冷」、「流著奶與蜜之地」、「聖靈」以及「主之地」。根據馬丁主義，8是基督的數字。"

      "en": "She has the lunar crescent at her feet, a horned diadem on her head, with a globe in the middle place, and a large solar cross on her breast. The scroll in her hands is inscribed with the word Tora, signifying the Greater Law, the Secret Law and the second sense of the Word. It is partly covered by her mantle, to shew that some things are implied and some spoken. She is seated between the white and black pillars--J. and B.--of the mystic Temple, and the veil of the Temple is behind her: it is embroidered with palms and pomegranates. The vestments are flowing and gauzy, and the mantle suggests light--a shimmering radiance. She has been called occult Science on the threshold of the Sanctuary of Isis, but she is really the Secret Church, the House which is of God and man. She represents also the Second Marriage of the Prince who is no longer of this world; she is the spiritual Bride and Mother, the daughter of the stars and the Higher Garden of Eden. She is, in fine, the Queen of the borrowed light, but this is the light of all. She is the Moon nourished by the milk of the Supernal Mother.\nIn a manner, she is also the Supernal Mother herself--that is to say, she is the bright reflection. It is in this sense of reflection that her truest and highest name in bolism is Shekinah--the co-habiting glory. According to Kabalism, there is a Shekinah both above and below. In the superior world it is called Binah, the Supernal Understanding which reflects to the emanations that are beneath. In the lower world it is MaIkuth--that world being, for this purpose, understood as a blessed Kingdom that with which it is made blessed being the Indwelling Glory. Mystically speaking, the Shekinah is the Spiritual Bride of the just man, and when he reads the Law she gives the Divine meaning. There are some respects in which this card is the highest and holiest of the Greater Arcana.",
      "zh": "她腳踏弦月，頭戴雙角冠，冠飾中央嵌著一顆寶珠，胸前佩戴著巨大的太陽十字。她手中所持的書卷刻有「妥拉」（Tora）一詞，象徵著至高法則、奧秘法則以及「聖言」的第二層涵義。書卷一部分被她的斗篷遮蓋，寓意著有些事物是意會的，有些則是言明的。\n\n她坐落於神秘殿堂的黑白雙柱——J. 與 B. 之間，殿堂的帷幕在她身後，上面繡有棕櫚葉和石榴。她的法袍輕柔飄逸，斗篷散發著光芒，閃耀著微光。她曾被稱為伊西斯聖殿門檻上的奧秘科學，但她實質上是秘密教會，一個神與人共存的殿堂。她也象徵著超脫塵世的王子之第二次結合；她是靈性新娘與母親，眾星之女以及更高層次的伊甸園。總之，她是借光之女王，但這光芒卻屬於萬物。她是飲用至高母性之乳而滋養的月亮。\n\n在某種意義上，她也是至高母性本身——換言之，她是光輝的映照。正是在這種映照的意義上，她在象徵學中最真實且崇高的名字是「舍吉拿」（Shekinah）——即「臨在的榮光」。根據卡巴拉（猶太神秘學）的說法，舍吉拿在上層世界和下層世界皆有存在。在上層世界中，她被稱為「比納」（Binah），意指至高理解，將其光輝映照給下方的流溢體。在下層世界中，她則被稱為「馬爾庫特」（Malkuth）——在此意義上，此世界被理解為一個受祝福的王國，而使其蒙受祝福的，正是「臨在的榮光」。從神秘學角度而言，舍吉那是正義之人的靈性新娘，當他研讀律法時，她便賦予其神聖的意義。在某些方面上，這張牌是大阿爾克那中最至高且神聖的。"

      "en": "A stately figure, seated, having rich vestments and royal aspect, as of a daughter of heaven and earth. Her diadem is of twelve stars, gathered in a cluster. The symbol of Venus is on the shield which rests near her. A field of corn is ripening in front of her, and beyond there is a fall of water. The sceptre which she bears is surmounted by the globe of this world. She is the inferior Garden of Eden, the Earthly Paradise, all that is symbolized by the visible house of man. She is not Regina coeli, but she is still refugium peccatorum, the fruitful mother of thousands. There are also certain aspects in which she has been correctly described as desire and the wings thereof, as the woman clothed with the sun, as Gloria Mundi and the veil of the Sanctum Sanctorum; but she is not, I may add, the soul that has attained wings, unless all the symbolism is counted up another and unusual way. She is above all things universal fecundity and the outer sense of the Word. This is obvious, because there is no direct message which has been given to man like that which is borne by woman; but she does not herself carry its interpretation.\nIn another order of ideas, the card of the Empress signifies the door or gate by which an entrance is obtained into this life, as into the Garden of Venus; and then the way which leads out therefrom, into that which is beyond, is the secret known to the High Priestess: it is communicated by her to the elect. Most old attributions of this card are completely wrong on the symbolism--as, for example, its identification with the Word, Divine Nature, the Triad, and so forth.",
      "zh": "一位姿態莊嚴的女性，安然坐著，身著華麗長袍，顯現王者風範，猶如天地孕育之女。她的冠冕由十二顆繁星簇擁而成。金星符號刻在其身旁倚靠的盾牌上。前方一片金黃玉米田，作物正值豐收，遠處有瀑布傾瀉而下。她手持的權杖頂端，飾以世界之球。她是塵世的伊甸園，人間天堂，象徵著人類可見的一切居所與存在。她並非「天堂之后」（Regina Coeli），卻是「罪人庇護所」（Refugium Peccatorum），亦是孕育千萬生命的豐饒之母。在某些詮釋中，她被視為「慾望及其羽翼」、身披烈日之女、「世俗榮耀」（Gloria Mundi）與「至聖所之幔」（Sanctum Sanctorum之幔）；但我必須補充，她並非已然展翅的靈魂，除非所有的象徵意義皆以另一種非比尋常的方式被解讀。她超越萬物，代表著宇宙的豐產與「道」的外顯意義。這點不言而喻，因為沒有任何直接的訊息能像由女性所承載的那樣傳遞給人類；然而她本身並不承載其解釋。\n\n從另一個層面來看，皇后牌象徵著通往此生的大門，如同進入金星之園；而引領人脫離此生，通往彼端的道路，則是女祭司所知曉的秘密：並由她將此秘密傳授給被選中的人。關於這張牌多數的舊有詮釋，在象徵意義上是全然錯誤的——例如將其等同於「道」、神聖本質、三位一體等等。"

He is a crowned monarch--commanding, stately, seated on a throne, the arms of which axe fronted by rams' heads. He is executive and realization, the power of this world, here clothed with the highest of its natural attributes. He is occasionally represented as seated on a cubic stone, which, however, confuses some of the issues. He is the virile power, to which the Empress responds, and in this sense is he who seeks to remove the Veil of Isis; yet she remains virgo intacta.\nIt should be understood that this card and that of the Empress do not precisely represent the condition of married life, though this state is implied. On the surface, as I have indicated, they stand for mundane royalty, uplifted on the seats of the mighty; but above this there is the suggestion of another presence. They signify also--and the male figure especially--the higher kingship, occupying the intellectual throne. Hereof is the lordship of thought rather than of the animal world. Both personalities, after their own manner, are \"full of strange experience,\" but theirs is not consciously the wisdom which draws from a higher world. The Emperor has been described as (a) will in its embodied form, but this is only one of its applications, and (b) as an expression of virtualities contained in the Absolute Being--but this is fantasy.",

      "en": "He wears the triple crown and is seated between two pillars, but they are not those of the Temple which is guarded by the High Priestess. In his left hand he holds a sceptre terminating in the triple cross, and with his right hand he gives the well-known ecclesiastical sign which is called that of esotericism, distinguishing between the manifest and concealed part of doctrine. It is noticeable in this connexion that the High Priestess makes no sign. At his feet are the crossed keys, and two priestly ministers in albs kneel before him. He has been usually called the Pope, which is a particular application of the more general office that he symbolizes. He is the ruling power of external religion, as the High Priestess is the prevailing genius of the esoteric, withdrawn power. The proper meanings of this card have suffered woeful admixture from nearly all hands. Grand Orient says truly that the Hierophant is the power of the keys, exoteric orthodox doctrine, and the outer side of the life which leads to the doctrine; but he is certainly not the prince of occult doctrine, as another commentator has suggested.\nHe is rather the summa totius theologiæ, when it has passed into the utmost rigidity of expression; but he symbolizes also all things that are righteous and sacred on the manifest side. As such, he is the channel of grace belonging to the world of institution as distinct from that of Nature, and he is the leader of salvation for the human race at large. He is the order and the head of the recognized hierarchy, which is the reflection of another and greater hierarchic order; but it may so happen that the pontiff forgets the significance of this his symbolic state and acts as if he contained within his proper measures all that his sign signifies or his symbol seeks to shew forth. He is not, as it has been thought, philosophy-except on the theological side; he is not inspiration; and he is not religion, although he is a mode of its expression.",

      "en": "The sun shines in the zenith, and beneath is a great winged figure with arms extended, pouring down influences. In the foreground are two human figures, male and female, unveiled before each other, as if Adam and Eve when they first occupied the paradise of the earthly body. Behind the man is the Tree of Life, bearing twelve fruits, and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is behind the woman; the serpent is twining round it. The figures suggest youth, virginity, innocence and love before it is contaminated by gross material desire. This is in all simplicity the card of human love, here exhibited as part of the way, the truth and the life. It replaces, by recourse to first principles, the old card of marriage, which I have described previously, and the later follies which depicted man between vice and virtue. In a very high sense, the card is a mystery of the Covenant and Sabbath.\nThe suggestion in respect of the woman is that she signifies that attraction towards the sensitive life which carries within it the idea of the Fall of Man, but she is rather the working of a Secret Law of Providence than a willing and conscious temptress. It is through her imputed lapse that man shall arise ultimately, and only by her can he complete himself.

Therefore the Hermit is not, as Court de Gebelin explained, a wise man in search of truth and justice; nor is he, as a later explanation proposes, an especial example of experience. His beacon intimates that \"where I am, you also may be.\"\nIt is further a card which is understood quite incorrectly when it is connected with the idea of occult isolation, as the protection of personal magnetism against admixture. This is one of the frivolous renderings which we owe to Éliphas Lévi. It has been adopted by the French Order of Martinism and some of us have heard a great deal of the Silent and Unknown Philosophy enveloped by his mantle from the knowledge of the profane. In true Martinism, the significance of the term Philosophe inconnu was of another order.

It is legitimate--as I have intimated--to use Egyptian symbolism when this serves our purpose, provided that no theory of origin is implied therein. I have, however, presented Typhon in his serpent form. The symbolism is, of course, not exclusively Egyptian, as the four Living Creatures of Ezekiel occupy the angles of the card, and the wheel itself follows other indications of Lévi in respect of Ezekiel's vision, as illustrative of the particular Tarot Key. With the French occultist, and in the design itself, the symbolic picture stands for the perpetual motion of a fluidic universe and for the flux of human life. The Sphinx is the equilibrium therein. The transliteration of Taro as Rota is inscribed on the wheel, counterchanged with the letters of the Divine Name--to shew that Providence is imphed through all. But this is the Divine intention within, and the similar intention without is exemplified by the four Living Creatures. Sometimes the sphinx is represented couchant on a pedestal above, which defrauds the symbolism by stultifying the essential idea of stability amidst movement.\nBehind the general notion expressed in the symbol there lies the denial of chance and the fatality which is implied therein. It may be added that, from the days of Lévi onward, the occult explanations of this card are--even for occultism itself--of a singularly fatuous kind. It has been said to mean principle, fecundity, virile honour, ruling authority, etc. The findings of common fortune-telling are better than this on their own plane.",

The latter belongs to a mysterious order of Providence, in virtue of which it is possible for certain men to conceive the idea of dedication to the highest things. The operation of this is like the breathing of the Spirit where it wills, and we have no canon of criticism or ground of explanation concerning it. It is analogous to the possession of the fairy gifts and the high gifts and the gracious gifts of the poet: we have them or have not, and their presence is as much a mystery as their absence.

The natural transit of man to the next stage of his being either is or may be one form of his progress, but the exotic and almost unknown entrance, while still in this life, into the state of mystical death is a change in the form of consciousness and the passage into a state to which ordinary death is neither the path nor gate.

These are analogous with those of the fifth card, as if Adam and Eve after the Fall. Hereof is the chain and fatality of the material life.\nThe figures are tailed, to signify the animal nature, but there is human intelligence in the faces, and he who is exalted above them is not to be their master for ever. Even now, he is also a bondsman, sustained by the evil that is in him and blind to the liberty of service. With more than his usual derision for the arts which he pretended to respect and interpret as a master therein, Éliphas Lévi affirms that the Baphometic figure is occult science and magic. Another commentator says that in the Divine world it signifies predestination, but there is no correspondence in that world with the things which below are of the brute. What it does signify is the Dweller on the Threshold without the Mystical Garden when those are driven forth therefrom who have eaten the forbidden fruit.",

      "en": "Occult explanations attached to this card are meagre and mostly disconcerting. It is idle to indicate that it depicts min in all its aspects, because it bears this evidence on the surface. It is said further that it contains the first allusion to a material building, but I do not conceive that the Tower is more or less material than the pillars which we have met with in three previous cases. I see nothing to warrant Papus in supposing that it is literally the fall of Adam, but there is more in favour of his alternative--that it signifies the materialization of the spiritual word. The bibliographer Christian imagines that it is the downfall of the mind, seeking to penetrate the mystery of God. I agree rather with Grand Orient that it is the ruin of the House of We, when evil has prevailed therein, and above all that it is the rending of a House of Doctrine. I understand that the reference is, however, to a House of Falsehood. It illustrates also in the most comprehensive way the old truth that \"except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.\"\nThere is a sense in which the catastrophe is a reflection from the previous card, but not on the side of the symbolism which I have tried to indicate therein. It is more correctly a question of analogy; one is concerned with the fall into the material and animal state, while the other signifies destruction on the intellectual side. The Tower has been spoken of as the chastisement of pride and the intellect overwhelmed in the attempt to penetrate the Mystery of God; but in neither case do these explanations account for the two persons who are the living sufferers. The one is the literal word made void and the other its false interpretation. In yet a deeper sense, it may signify also the end of a dispensation, but there is no possibility here for the consideration of this involved question.",
      "zh": "關於這張牌的奧義解讀稀少且多數令人不安。無須贅述此牌描繪了人類的方方面面，因為這點已然昭然若揭。據說，此牌首次影射了物質建築，然吾不認為高塔的物質性，會與我們在前三張牌中遇到的柱子有何不同。我未見任何依據可證實帕普斯(Papus)所說，此牌實指亞當的墮落；反倒其另一種說法——象徵著靈性言詞的物質化——更具說服力。書目學家克里斯蒂安(Christian)則設想，這是企圖洞悉神之奧秘的心智的墮落。我較為認同大東方(Grand Orient)的觀點，認為這是當邪惡盛行其間時，吾人殿堂的傾頹，而最重要的是，它代表著教義殿堂的崩毀。然我理解，此處所指乃為虛偽之殿。它也以最全面的方式闡釋了那句古老真理：「若非主所建造，建造者勞力必將徒然。」\n\n在某種意義上，這場災難是前一張牌的映照，但並非從我試圖闡明的前一張牌的象徵層面。更確切地說，這是一個類比的問題；一者關乎墮入物質與動物性狀態，而另一者則象徵著心智層面上的毀滅。高塔曾被視為傲慢的懲罰，以及心智在企圖洞悉神之奧秘時的潰敗；但這兩種解釋皆未能說明，牌中那兩位活生生的受苦者所代表的意義。其中一者是文字本義的虛空化，另一者則是對其錯誤的詮釋。若以更深層的意義而言，它亦可象徵一個時代的終結，然在此處，我們無法深入探討此一複雜議題。"

For the majority of prepared minds, the figure will appear as the type of Truth unveiled, glorious in undying beauty, pouring on the waters of the soul some part and measure of her priceless possession.

It has sixteen chief and sixteen secondary rays. The card represents life of the imagination apart from life of the spirit. The path between the towers is the issue into the unknown. The dog and wolf are the fears of the natural mind in the presence of that place of exit, when there is only reflected light to guide it.\nThe last reference is a key to another form of symbolism. The intellectual light is a reflection and beyond it is the unknown mystery which it cannot shew forth. It illuminates our animal nature, types of which are represented below--the dog, the wolf and that which comes up out of the deeps, the nameless and hideous tendency which is lower than the savage beast. It strives to attain manifestation, symbolized by crawling from the abyss of water to the land, but as a rule it sinks back whence it came. The face of the mind directs a calm gaze upon the unrest below; the dew of thought falls; the message is: Peace, be still; and it may be that there shall come a calm upon the animal nature, while the abyss beneath shall cease from giving up a form.",

The sun is that of consciousness in the spirit - the direct as the antithesis of the reflected light. The characteristic type of humanity has become a little child therein--a child in the sense of simplicity and innocence in the sense of wisdom.

It represents also the perfection and end of the Cosmos, the secret which is within it, the rapture of the universe when it understands itself in God. It is further the state of the soul in the consciousness of Divine Vision, reflected from the self-knowing spirit. But these meanings are without prejudice to that which I have said concerning it on the material side.\nIt has more than one message on the macrocosmic side and is, for example, the state of the restored world when the law of manifestation shall have been carried to the highest degree of natural perfection. But it is perhaps more especially a story of the past, referring to that day when all was declared to be good, when the morning stars sang together and all the Sons of God shouted for joy. One of the worst explanations concerning it is that the figure symbolizes the Magus when he has reached the highest degree of initiation; another account says that it represents the absolute, which is ridiculous. The figure has been said to stand for Truth, which is, however, more properly allocated to the seventeenth card. Lastly, it has been called the Crown of the Magi.",

The bull's head should be noted as a recurrent symbol on the throne. The sign of this suit is represented throughout as engraved or blazoned with the pentagram, typifying the correspondence of the four elements in human nature and that by which they may be governed. In many old Tarot packs this suit stood for current coin, money, deniers. I have not invented the substitution of pentacles and I have no special cause to sustain in respect of the alternative. But the consensus of divinatory meanings is on the side of some change, because the cards do not happen to deal especially with questions of money.",
